# Syphon

*Syphon: The Worst Language You Could Ever Learn*.

## Features (So Far)

- Function definitions
- Conditional statements (`if`)
- For loops
- Variable declarations (mutable and immutable)
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ++;, --;)

## Confirmed Coming Soon

- `elif` and `else`
- `foreach` and `while` loops
- Full rewrite (code too ugly)
- Multi-line comments

## Confirmed Never Coming Soon

- Classes; object orientation sucks.
